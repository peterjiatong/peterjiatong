## WORK EXPERIENCE

### Software Engineer Internship

*Centre Testing International Group Corporation*, (05/2025 - present), Remote

* Built and deployed web-based RAG assistant for environmental lab reports, enabling analysts to upload PDFs and query about documents with page-level citations, cutting lookup time by 80%
* Engineered the retrieval pipeline with LangChain and Deepseek-reasoner API for document loading, splitting, retrieving and generating, added a vector store cache to reduce latency
* Designed frontend using React, HTML/CSS, and Ant Design, that improved user experience and UI performance
* Implemented RESTful APIs via Node.js and Express, optimized for high-performance request handling

### Research Assistant

Artificial Intelligence Explainability Accountability (AIEA) Lab, UC Santa Cruz(04/2023 - 05/2024), Santa Cruz, CA

* Autonomous Vehicle Incident Reports Analysis
  * Collected and parsed over 1,000 autonomous vehicle incident reports from California DMV and NHTSA PDFs with **PyPDF2**
  * Conducted extensive data cleaning and preprocessing using **Pandas** and **Numpy**, by dropping irrelevant information, encoding
    non-computable data, and applying normalization techniques, the data quality is improved by approximately 30%
  * Performed chi-square tests with **SciPy** to evaluate the association between categorical variables and vehicle types, then utilized
    **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to create clear visualizations that were included in the AIEA Lab research paper
* Driving Rulebook Interpreter
  * Developed a Chinese interpreter that enhanced the AIEA Labâ€™s driving-rules project, extending the functionality to process the
    DMV Driving Rulebook in Chinese
  * Utilized **NLTK** and **Jieba** for Tokenizing and Part-of-Speech Tagging, then transformed driving rules into a structured
    "IF-THEN" format by extracting key terms using the TF-IDF method
  * Utilized **Google Translation API** to translate "IF-THEN" structured rules from Chinese to English, streamlining data preparation
    for statistical analysis in multilingual research contexts
